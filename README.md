<h1>Basic Snake Game</h1> 

<h3>Welcome to the Basic Snake Game repository!</h3>
<p>This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. However, if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area, it's game over!</p>
